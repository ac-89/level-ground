        <p>
          At Level Ground (LG), urban youth cultivate grit and resilience
          through Mixed Martial Arts. They learn to apply these values 'off the
          mat' in the pursuit of their ambitions through our Student Trainer
          Certification and College Access programs.

        <h2>WHY</h2>
        <p>
          On top of the obvious physical benefits, Level Ground training
          provides a sense of community and belonging, as participants train
          together and develop supportive relationships with coaches and
          teammates. We also teach important values such as sportsmanship, fair
          play, and respect for opponents, which can be applied to all areas of
          life.
